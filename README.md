# Trickcal Re:Vive Team Manager

A web-based tool for managing deck, recommending decks, and simulating strategies in the mobile game Trickcal Re:Vive. Built with React, TypeScript, and Vite, this project helps players optimize their gameplay by analyzing apostles (characters), presets, synergies, and more.

## Project Overview

This tool is designed to enhance the Trickcal Re:vive experience by:

- Recommending optimal decks based on user-owned apostles.
- Simulating deck performance, including damage calculations, synergies, and role balances.
- Providing guides, tier lists, and data-driven insights for PVE/PVP content like Elias Frontier, Dimension Crash, Invasion.
- Allowing users to manage presets, analyze apostle stats, and explore game data (e.g., skills, artifacts, asides).

Key features include:

- **Deck Simulator** : Simulates deck performance to predict battle outcomes, including damage calculations, skill effects, personality synergies.
- **Deck Recommender** : Generates recommendations using algorithms.
- **Apostle Management** : Lists, searches, and selects apostles with personality filters.
- **Synergy Analysis** : Calculates scores for base, synergy, and total performance.
- **Preset and Recommendation Sections** : Displays preset combinations and recommended decks in grid views.
